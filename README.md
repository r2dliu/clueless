This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

run `npm i` to install modules (one time setup)
run `npm run dev` to boot up server and game for development.
open up `localhost:8000`. alter files in `pages/index.js` to start developing!
you can open up the same link in multiple tabs or different windows and note that they are automatically synced up!

server and client both share the game.js
